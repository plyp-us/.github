## Practice Like You Play

### You Define Your Future Through With Your Elevated Discipline

Perfect who you will become by continuously elevating the level of your practice.

Analyze, Imagine, Create, Realize ... but you elevate by starting where you are

### Eat Your Own Dogfood

Elevate your practice; practice your discipline to elevate your discipline for tomorrow.

Continuously improve so that your perfected discipline is continuous improvement.

### Minimize Your Baggage

Sustain what sustains you, but first eliminate unnecessary extravagances while you simplify and set in order; then you can shine and polish while you continue to standardize and systematize.

Most of what your life is about, including most of what people will tell you is necessary, is actually baggage and impediments that keep you from elevating your discipline.
