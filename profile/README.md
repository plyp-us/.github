## Practice Like You Play

### You Must Be You

You define who you will become; it's all up to you.

Create, Imagine, Realize ... but be Un-Categorizable

### Eat Your Own Dogfood

Develop your own discipline, but practice what you preach.

Improve your discipline with disciplined practice and continuously improved discipline.
